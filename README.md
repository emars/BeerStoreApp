The Beer Store App (Pending good name)

NOTE: This app is still very much a work in progress

About: The Beer Store in Ontario, Canada sells hundreds of different
beers in varying container sizes.

Very often, there will be a pricing on a certain size of beer that allows that beer
to be purchased cheaper.

I found myself trying to work this out in my head every time I went to the store,
so I thought that an app that does it for me would be worth my while.

This app queries thebeerstore.ca for all beers and their respective pricing and stores
them in a database.
